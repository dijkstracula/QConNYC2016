[Introduction & Motivation: 3 minutes]

-Who am I
  - I’m Nathan, I work on highly concurrent C codebases and language runtimes; in grad school I worked on dynamic analysis tools to improve program performance

-What is dynamic analysis
  - To cite: The Concept of Dynamic Analysis
  - Two implementation techniques: build "walled simulation" around system to observe (the SNES emulator model), or run natively and inject instrumentation into the system (the early hypervisor model)

- Classic use cases: 
  - input for developers understanding a new codebase
  - debugging crashes & races "We must remind ourselves again that history as usually written (peccavimus) is quite different from history as usually lived: the historian records the exceptional because it is interesting-because it is exceptional."
  - security analysis of obfuscated binaries or malware

-Why should you care about this talk
  - huge gulf between acadmic work on dynamic analysis tools and what we see in production
  - many techniques shared with other areas you might find interesting, like virtualization and just-in-time compilers
  - advanced techniques require hardware support, but hardware companies are watching out for what software people want...
  - more powerful tools require greater performance sacrifices: knowing the lay of the land will help you better choose what techniques are right for your needs 

-Static vs dynamic analysis
  - why not Just Use Types? What must we do dynamically that we can't do statically?
  - Static analysis: conservative approximation of runtime behaviour
    - programs are only partially known (dynamic linking, user input), set of possibilities becomes huge
    - it is imprecise: consider incorrect programs that a type checker would permit; pointer analysis, esp across shared objects / class files
    - many language specs assume depend on single thread for defn of program correctness; race conditions can slip through the cracks here
    - cite: On The LImits Of Infomation Flow, Dynamic Analysis from the Ground Up
  - Dynamic analysis: can't prove correctness but can demonstrate failure

- Talk plan
  - Begin with a conventional debugger, and extend the ideas there successively for increasingly-powerful & difficult forms of analysis
    - Memory tracking
    - Online Record & Offline Replay
    - Full-system analysis
    - Multicore Considerations
    - Hardware Support / Wishlist


[Memory tracking: 20 minutes]

- A gentle introduction: time travelling debugging
  - Problem statement: What assigned this pointer value to 7? (cite The Night's Watch)

- Time-travelling debugging: GDB7, some experimental Java runtimes [5 minutes]
  - Consider a null pointer dereference crash: What does a stack trace not get you?
    - Functions that have returned
    - Previous / overwritten program state
  - Traditional debugging approach: from crash, set increasingly early breakpoints & restart to walk backwards in time - O(n^2)
  - Idea: create a data structure that allows the debugger to reconstruct the program state at a given period of time
  - GDB 7: the most straightforward way to build this
    - Doubly-linked list of register & memory writes (./gdb/record-full.c)
    - Single-step & instruction emulation.  Very slow!
    - Not a criticism, serves to show that you don't need highly optimized algorithms to build a dynamic analysis tool
    - Demo, maybe?
  - Focus on usability rather than performance typical in the research literature.

- How better to store trace information [2.5 minutes]
  - Having to replay all operations (see ReVirt) to get to a particular state is suboptimal
  - Scalable Omniscient Debugging: B+ tree
    - Optimized for high-speed offline recording rather than replaying - does this meet your usecase better?
  - TTVM: checkpoint with redo/undo log
    - contains CPU registers, memory state, virtualized disk
    - Differences in checkpoints are stored via COW
    - To reach a place, restore most recent checkpoint and walk forward (using redo log) or back (using undo log)
    - Only stores non-deterministic events!  With the state stored at checkpoints, that's enough to replay the full execution
  - We will have more to say about this in the SMP world

- Speeding execution up with JITs [5 minutes]
  - Data driven rather than execution-driven: Use techniques from language runtimes to build more flexible analysis tools
  - Don't store record of how the program mutates itself over time, but recompile itself to add arbitrary instrumentation
    - JIT: Rather than compiling bytecode to native instructions, TRANSLATE native to native (with instrumentation)
  - Most instructions (arithmetic, data moves, etc) are unchanged; we just have to make sure we don't escape the JIT
    - Jumps have to go to code that we generated, not back to the original code segment
      - Pin: clone the code segment as it executes, weaving extra instrumentation and jump rewrites in as you go
      - Walk through example w/ indirect target chaining?
    - Valgrind: "disassemble and resynthesize" - decompile to an IR, weave in IR-level instrumentation, reassemble
      -  Have to mention Shadow Memory for AddressSanitizer, probably SMT-ReVirt too

- Memory tracking in practice [7.5 minutes]
  - Problem statement: what values did a variable / piece of memory have over time? how does a value get copied through the system?
  - All this sounds enticing because it can be applied to unmodified software, and we claim no false positives
  - TaintBochs: observes "sensitive" data (like passwords)'s lifetimes in major applications: Perl, Mozilla, Apache
    - Begin with sensitive data from "the outside world" (e.g. keyboard entry, network traffic), watch the taint spread through the system
    - Any operation that uses "sensitive" data is itself tainted and considered sensitive too
      - Copying data obviously taints it, but what about processor instruction with output that is a function of tainted input?
      - "if any byte of any input value is tainted, then all bytes of the output are tainted.
    - Problems with this approach:
      - Lookup tables - output is a function of _control flow changes_ that depended on input
      - entropy-seeking devices - eg. keyboard entry used to seed RNG, which can be used everywhere in the system
      - Claimed to not be a problem in practice
    - Walk through Mozilla example
  - "Pointless Tainting" - a more cynical view.  No false positives but what about false negatives?
    - Focused on the limitations of this idea - easy to circumvent if trying to analyze malware
    - benign actions like configuring IP addresses causes explosion of tainted memory


[Multicore considerations: 20 minutes]

- Limitations of the above [ 2 minutes]
  - We assume a single thread of operation, or a single processor system!
    - Either we haven't explicitly mentioned SMP or we assume single thread of execution
  - in a multiprocessor environment, a non-deterministic event that we have to record is outcomes of memory races

-SMP Record & Replay [5 minutes]
  - What's hard about concurrency
    - News flash: your computer is a distributed system
    - In a single-threaded context, non-deterministic events are still synchronous; now we consider non-determinism in timing
  - Can build SMP record/replay systems by serializing threads or tracking synchronization (e.g. "who gets the lock" or
"who gets scheduled to run")
    - Show Valgrind tool that does this
    - But, this means data races, usually the problems we want to look for, are lost and remain ambiguous!
  - Literature mostly assumes a sequentially consistent memory system
    - Happens-Before (Lamport: Time, Clocks, and Ordering of Events in a Distributed System)
      - happens-before relation can therefore be computed using vector clocks
    - CREW protocol: everyone has read permission, nobody has write permission, OR, one has RW, no one else has anything
      - SMP-ReVirt: "two processors accessing the same page w/ one being a write, a CREW event is emitted to adjust permissions"
      - Implemented by hardware page protection. How do we we do this without confusing the underlying system? Hypervisor + shadow page tables
      - This doesn't work for DMA, which is totally under the control of the hardware.  Future work might require custom hardware...
    - Generally-speaking, Happens-Before generates no false positives but hard to implement efficiently

- Race detection [10 minutes?]
  - Different but very practical problem: don't need to record entire execution but only observe a failure of locking dicipline
  - Examples: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerPopularDataRaces
  - Implementation: implement all read and writes, and all calls to lock() and unlock(), across all threads
      - You have techniques to do this now!
  - Eraser: Uses lockset rather than Happens-Before property
    - Show example that H-B would miss
    - Show iterative refinement algorithm: if the set of locks that protect a variable becomes empty, we've found a potential datarace
      - Potential because the two threads may not have interfered with each other
    - "Performance was not a goal" : 10x - 30x slowdown
    - Valgrind-style shadow memory used to store locksets for each shared variable.
  - ThreadSanitizer: a hybrid of happens-before and lockset; used by (among other things) Chromium and Golang
    - Weaves instrumenting at compile-time, just as a JIT would do (but originally implemented in Valgrind)
      - Compile time http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/llvm/trunk/lib/Transforms/Instrumentation/ThreadSanitizer.cpp?view=markup
      - Runtime https://github.com/llvm-mirror/compiler-rt/blob/310285e9d8cf5a817d0788ec9ba509009bf748bd/lib/tsan/rtl/tsan_rtl.cc#L745
        - pseudocode? https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerAlgorithm
    - Lockset appraoch doesn't entirely work for golang because syncrhonization happens by passing objects between threads via channels
      - CSP cited in particular http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/10fa-e6998/papers/hybrid.pdf

- relaxed determinism [3 minutes]

Extra stuff

[Full-system instrumentation in practice: 5 minutes ]

-Full-system instrumentation
  - We started with a userspace debugger and ended with a full-system memory tracker; what is different between userspace and full-system?
    - userspace tools sit in the space between the OS and the instrumented program by using features of the OS
    - What's under the OS?  Either hardware emulators or a virtual machine monitor!
      - We'll talk about hardware-specific extensions at the end
    - Why is full-system instrumentation important?
      - Use-cases like taint tracking require tracking how something propagates through the computer starting from hardware

- Limitations of the above
  - really requires an insertion shim like a language runtime or a VMM, unless you're able to modify the compiler
  - How far can we get for full-system dynamic analysis without virtualization?

-Linux instrumentation with BCC, BPF, and probes
  - BCC: framework for dynamic full-system instrumentation of Linux & applications
  - BPF: an "in-kernel virtual machine" that compiles, validates, and executes bytecode
    - bytecode defined in bpf_common.h
    - bpf_jit_comp.c : dojit()
  - Probe system: tldr allows callbacks to be invoked when a piece of memory is accessed
TODO
  - Limitations: you don't have that shim btw hardware and the OS to interpose on full-system memory access
